## Code

This directory contains Rust and Python code for the different optimization
methods covered in the course.

### Optimisation-methods

This directory includes Rust implementations of several optimization methods:

1. Bisection Method
2. Golden Section Method
3. Chord Method
4. Newton's Method
5. Quadratic Approximation

### Gradient descend

This directory includes a Rust implementation of the Gradient Descent method.

### Genetic algorithm

This directory includes a Python implementation of a Genetic Algorithm for
solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

## LaTeX and files

This directory includes all remaining latex and pdf files for laboratory work reports and tasks:

- **Lab 2** - Computational Optimization Methods
  - Implemented in [optimisation methods](./Code/optimisation-methods/)
- **Lab 3** - Quadratic Approximation
  - Also implemented in [optimisation methods](./Code/optimisation-methods/)
- **Lab 4** - Multidimensional Optimization
  - Implemented in [gradient descent](./Code/gradient-descend/)
- **Lab 5** - Linear Programming Tasks
  - There is no programming involved
- **Lab 6** - Traveling Salesman Problem
  - Implemented in [genetic algorithm](./Code/genetic-algorithm/)

## Lectures

This directory includes all lectures in `.pdf` format sorted by order.

## Transport problem and optimization coursework

This directory contains the final coursework, where I solve transport problem for a complex transport network and optimise an animal feeding problem
